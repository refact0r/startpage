# Startpage Rose Pine

My fork of a clean [startpage](https://github.com/refact0r/startpage) made with Svelte by [refact0r](https://github.com/refact0r) to add some soho vibes.

## My modifications:

- Made for a new system customization with [Rose Pine Color Scheme](https://github.com/rose-pine).
- Design for this one is friendly and more responsive to tiled windows taking half a screen. Flexbox changed to column, clock with feature image moved to top and flow of the page is kept vertical.
- Changed the cloud icon to one using pseudoelements to avoid some weird div border artifacts (not sure if browser or color related) happening when box shadows were used.
- Removed swappable gifs, instead only one is used by default, but made to match the Rose Pine colors really nice.
